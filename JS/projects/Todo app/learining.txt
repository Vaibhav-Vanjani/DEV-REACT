<input> is a self-closing / void element:
<input type="text" value="Hello" />


It does not have any child nodes (no inner content).

So innerText, innerHTML, and textContent are meaningless here.

Its content lives in its value attribute.


1) class / id name should be consistent 
2) for nested sub class/id use __
3) for modifier classed use --
4) for constant use const and define on top 
5) use querySelector for first occurence DOM elements
6) let for mutable elements
7) .remove() --> removes element from DOM
8) use data-attributes rather than manipulation on static value
9) use function for better readability
